Installing Vino from source is the best way to be up-to-date for now.

## Clone from git

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vinodotdev/vino && cd vino
```

## Install with `make`

```sh
$ make install
```

## Run tests

If you're developing with Vino, you can run the full test suite with:

```sh
$ make test
```
